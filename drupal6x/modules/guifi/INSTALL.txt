Install & configuration of guifi.net module:
--------------------------------------------

- Install & configure your site with a supported drupal engine (6.x)

- Enable your site  with clean url's 
  (Administer->Site configuration->Clean URLs)
  Apache's mod_rewrite has to be enabled

- Place the guifi.net module files in the standard drupal subdirectory tree 
  for modules (modules/guifi).
  Take the files from the SVN latest release, ex. of anonymous get:
    Being at the modules directory:
    # svn co --username anonymous 
      https://svn.projectes.lafarga.cat/svn/guifi/drupal6x/modules .
    Being at the themes directory (once it gets available, in the meantime, 
    the most tested theme is garland):
    
- Enable guifi.net module by checking the check box and save the changes
  (Administer->Site building->Modules->guifi.net)
  This will create all the initial database schema needed by guifi.net module  

- Set up the permission controls for guifi.net
  You might consider to create a few roles before, such as "network admins" and
  "network contributors", you can do so at:
  (Administer->User Management->Roles)
  Grant the permissions at each role at:
  (Administer->User Management->Roles / edit permissions)

- Configure the guifi.net general parameters
  (Administer->Site configuration->guifi.net configuration)
    
- Create you first geographic zones tree to be able to host your nodes:
  (create content->guifi.net zone)
  I.e.: you could make a geography zone tree which appears like:
  
  <State/Region>
    <County>
      <City A>
        <Neighborhood B>
        <Neighborhood C>
      <Village D>
        <Neighborhood E>
        <Neighborhood F>

- Network IPv4 ranges allocations
  Assign at least one public and one private ipv4 network ranges allocations to 
  be used to allocate network IP addresses for your futures nodes. Following
  the original freenetworks.org convention, the public range should be a unique
  range for your network within the 10.0.0.0/8 range, and the internal ranges
  fall within the 172.16.x.x. 
  Public ranges must be distinct in every network you would like to have 
  direct connection without NAT.
  Networks can be assigned by network administrators granted users by accessing
  to a zone, and then use tab "Add ipv4 network"
  As an example, you can give an 10.0.0.0/16 as a public range for your ROOT
  zone and a 172.16.0.0/23 for your private ranges.
  You can assign also distinct ranges within other zones of the zone hierarchy
  tree, if you don't, when a zone child requests an IPv4 address, will be taken
  a free network range from its parents. To avoid network fragmentation but keep
  an optimization usage, first range will be taken with a /24 mask, and once 
  gets completely used, will take a /23, then a /22 ... and so on.
  
- (Optional) 
  (To be reworked)
  Install & configure your own mapping system using guifi.net 
  OpenGIS mapping system, or federate with an existing one, to create your own 
  WMS mapping network diagrams.
  In the meantime, at the guifi.net module configuration you could setup a 
  Google Maps API key, and simply point to the production guifi.net WMS standard 
  layers.
  
- (Optional)
  Allocate the guifi.net statistics block in one of the regions
  
- Start creating your network by creating nodes, devices, services and linking
  them! 
  
- Enjoy.

Developer's tips & tricks:
--------------------------
- You should consider to install the drupal Devel module to help you
- Feel free to provide patches to the current SUBVERSION release
- You can activate trace levels by going to the guifi.net configuration page
  (Administer->Site configuration->guifi.net)
- You can use our template with an Zone, nodes and network examples. Requiere FULL clean drupal and guifi.net module installation.
  You can find it on a contrib/template/sample.sql file.
  
NOTES:
  Local LOS graphs require the gnuplot package installed and a grid file,
  Currently there is a grid file available only for Catalonia (cata.grd).
  LOS for the rest of the world are obtained by external links to 
  heywhatsthat.com 
  If you are synching with the SVN development version, use the "rebuild menus"
  option often to update registered url calls, if not AHAH calls would fail.
