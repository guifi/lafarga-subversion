NEW FEATURES in guifi.net module v4.0

New Features:
- Notification engine, every zone/node/device contact address will be contacted
  with a summary of the changes/insert/updates where he might be affected.
- New abbreviation algorithm used by default at zone level, in case the user
  doesn't provide it. The abbreviation is used while constructing the SSID using
  the mask:
    guifi.net-ZoneNodeRd#mode
- Now the multiple radio devices are always numbered sequentally starting from 0 
  and radios can be moved up & down, so can be reordered to match the position
  on the device.
  
User interface:
- Collapsible forms to make complex forms such as edit device simpler and more
  user friendly.
- Integration with google maps (module GMap required) while creating/editing
  nodes to select lat/lon coordinates.
- Filter forms while listing candidate devices/interfaces to link with
- Now while listing neighbors nodes, provides a small icon with the line of 
  sight directly in the same report page
- Reworked breadcrumbs when makes sense, integrated with drupal's breadcrumbs

Database:
- Add comments on tables to document primary/foreign key relationships
- Complete rework on the database INS/DEL/UPD engine to enforce database 
  integrity. Now creates a complete dynamic statements, with no dependencies
  in column names, linked to the notification engine and with separated 
  delete, insert & update triggers for each table.
  See: _guifi_db_delete and _guifi_db_sql at guifi_includes.inc.php
- The database schema is created/dropped by using the new drupal 5.2 install 
  and uninstall procedures.
