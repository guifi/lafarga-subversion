    <p>At this point, you probably realize that graphing is Cacti's greatest strength. Cacti has many powerful features that provide complex graphing and data acquisition, some which have a slight learning curve. Do not let that stop you however, because graphing your network is incredibly simple.</p>

    <p>The next two sections will outline the two basic steps which are typically required to create graphs for most devices.</p>

    <div class="SECT1">
      <h1 class="SECT1"><a name="NEW_DEVICE" id="NEW_DEVICE">Creating a Device</a></h1>

      <p>The first step to creating graphs for your network is adding a device for each network device that you want to create graphs for. A device specifies important details such as the network hostname, SNMP parameters, and host type.</p>

      <p>To manage devices within Cacti, click on the <span class="GUILABEL">Devices</span> menu item. Clicking <span class="GUILABEL">Add</span> will bring up a new device form. The first two fields, <span class="GUILABEL">Description</span> and <span class="GUILABEL">Hostname</span> are the only two fields that require your input beyond the defaults. If your host type is defined under the host template dropdown, be sure to select it here. You can always choose "Generic SNMP-enabled Host" if you are just graphing traffic or "None" if you are unsure. It is important to remember that the host template you choose will not lock you into any particular configuration, it will just provide more intelligent defaults for that type of host.</p>

      <p>After saving your new device, you should be redirected back to the same edit form with some additional information. If you configured SNMP for this host by providing a valid community string, you should see various statistics listed at the top of the page. If you see "SNMP error" instead, this indicates an SNMP problem between Cacti and your device.</p>

      <p>Towards the bottom of the page there will be two addition boxes, <span class="GUILABEL">Associated Data Queries</span>, and <span class="GUILABEL">Associated Graph Templates</span>. If you selected a host template on the previous page, there will probably be a few items in each box. If there is nothing listed in either box, you will need to associate at least one data query or graph template with your new device or you will not be able to create graphs in the next step. If no available graph template or data query applies to your device, you can check the Cacti templates repository or create your own if nothing currently exists.</p>

        <p>The SNMP version that you choose can have a great effect on how SNMP works for you in Cacti. Version 1 should be used for everything unless you have reason to choose otherwise. If you plan on utilizing (and your device supports) high-speed (64-bit) counters, you must select version 2. Starting with Cacti 0.8.7, version 3 is fully implemented.</p>

        <p>The way in which Cacti retrieves SNMP information from a host has an effect on which SNMP-related options are supported. Currently there are three types of SNMP retrieval methods in Cacti and are outlined below.</p>

        <p>SNMP supports authentication and encryption features when using SNMP protocol version 3 known as <b class="EMPHASIS">View-Based Access Control Model (VACM)</b>. This requires, that the target device in question supports and is configured for SNMP V3 use. In general, configuration of V3 options is target type dependant. The following is cited from <kbd class="USERINPUT">man snmpd.conf</kbd> concerning user definitions</p>
        <pre class="SCREEN">
[<span class="CITATION">   <b class="EMPHASIS">SNMPv3 Users</b>
       createUser [-e ENGINEID] username (MD5|SHA) authpassphrase [DES|AES] [privpassphrase]

              MD5 and SHA are the authentication types to use.  DES and AES are the privacy
              protocols  to  use. If  the  privacy  passphrase  is not specified, it is assumed
              to be the same as the authentication passphrase.  Note that the users created will
              be useless unless they are also added  to  the  VACM access control tables
              described above.

              SHA  authentication  and DES/AES privacy require OpenSSL to be installed and the
              agent to be built with OpenSSL support.  MD5 authentication may be used without
              OpenSSL.

              Warning: the minimum pass phrase length is 8 characters.</span>]
</pre>

        <p>VACM directives are explained from <kbd class="USERINPUT">man snmpd.conf</kbd> as follows</p>
        <pre class="SCREEN">
[<span class="CITATION">   <b class="EMPHASIS">VACM Configuration</b>
       The full flexibility of the VACM is available using four configuration directives -
       com2sec, group,  view and access.  These provide direct configuration of the underlying
       VACM tables.

       com2sec  [-Cn CONTEXT] SECNAME SOURCE COMMUNITY
              map  an  SNMPv1 or SNMPv2c community string to a security name - either from a
              particular range of source addresses, or globally ("default").  A restricted
              source can either be a specific  hostname (or  address),  or  a  subnet -
              represented as IP/MASK (e.g. 10.10.10.0/255.255.255.0), or IP/BITS
              (e.g. 10.10.10.0/24), or the IPv6 equivalents.

              The same community string can be specified in several separate directives
              (presumably with different  source  tokens), and the first source/community
              combination that matches the incoming request will be selected.  Various
              source/community combinations can also map to the same security name.

              If a CONTEXT is specified (using -Cn), the community string will be mapped
              to a security  name  in the named SNMPv3 context. Otherwise the default
              context ("") will be used.

       group GROUP {v1|v2c|usm} SECNAME
              maps  a  security name (in the specified security model) into a named group.
              Several group directives can specify the same group name, allowing a single
              access setting to apply to several  users and/or community strings.

              Note  that  groups must be set up for the two community-based models separately -
              a single com2sec (or equivalent) directive will typically be accompanied by two
              group directives.

       view VNAME TYPE OID [MASK]
              defines a named "view" - a subset of the overall OID tree. This is most commonly
              a single subtree, but  several view directives can be given with the same view
              name, to build up a more complex collection of OIDs.  TYPE is either included
              or excluded, which can again define a more complex view (e.g by excluding certain
              sensitive objects from an otherwise accessible subtree).

              MASK is a list of hex octets (separated by <span class="QUOTE">"."</span> or <span class="QUOTE">":"</span>)
              with the set bits indicating which subidentifiers in the view OID to match against.
              This can be used to define a view covering a particular row  (or  rows) in a table.
              If not specified, this defaults to matching the OID exactly (all bits set), thus
              defining a simple OID subtree.

       access GROUP CONTEXT {any|v1|v2c|usm} LEVEL PREFX READ WRITE NOTIFY
              maps from a group of users/communities (with a particular security model
              and  minimum  security level, and in a specific context) to one of three views,
              depending on the request being processed.

              LEVEL is one of noauth, auth, or priv.  PREFX specifies how CONTEXT should be
              matched against  the context  of  the  incoming  request, either exact or prefix.
              READ, WRITE and NOTIFY specifies the view to be used for GET*, SET and
              TRAP/INFORM requests (althought the NOTIFY view is not currently used).  For
              v1 or v2c access, LEVEL will need to be noauth.</span>]
