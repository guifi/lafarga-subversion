This is a simple smiley-filter that allows the easy use of graphical
smileys (or 'emoticons') on a Drupal site. It comes with a set of example
smileys, but you can define an unlimited amount of custom smileys as well.

NOTE: Please don't rip the example smileys and use them without this module.
      I spent quite some time creating those little buggers.

Installation
------------

1. Create the SQL table. This depends a little on your system, but the most
   common method is:
     mysql -u username -ppassword drupal < smileys.mysql

2. Copy the smileys.module to the Drupal modules/ directory.

3. Go to the administration section, into "adminster > modules"
   and enable the smileys module.

4. Now you can either:
    (a) Add the included example smileys to your SQL tables by using:
         mysql -u username -ppassword drupal < examples.mysql

    (b) Go to the "smileys" page in "administer > filters" and
        add your own smileys. There are two blank smiley pictures included in
        the examples directory to get you started.

5. If you selected (a) above, create a new directory called 'smileys' in the
   'misc' directory on your Drupal site. Copy all the images from the
   'examples' directory there.
   
6. (optionally) Go to "administer > filters > ordering" and
   adjust the filter order to resolve any filter conflicts.

Updating
--------

If you have an older version of smileys that requires you to enter each acronym
separately, you'll have to update the smileys table with the following SQL
command:

 ALTER TABLE smileys CHANGE acronym acronyms varchar(255) DEFAULT '' NOT NULL;

If you have smileys with several acronyms defined, you should edit them in the
administration interface and group them into one entry.

However, if you're only using the example smileys, it's easier to simply insert
the new smileys.mysql and examples.mysql into your database. The old table will
automatically be dropped and recreated.
