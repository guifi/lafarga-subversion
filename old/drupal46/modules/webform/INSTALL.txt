Requirements
------------

Drupal 4.6


Installation
------------
1. If you use as DB prefix in the site configuration you need to update the
   webform.mysql file and add the prefix to all tablenames.
   This can be done by using the scripts/prefix.sh available in the Drupal 
   main distribution.

2. Create the SQL tables. This depends a little on your system, but the most
   common method is:
     mysql -u username -ppassword drupal < webform.mysql

3. Copy the webform.module and webform.inc to the Drupal modules/ directory.

4. Enable the module in the admin interface.

5. (Optional) Edit the settings under "admin" -> "settings" -> "webform"

Upgrading from previous version
-------------------------------

1. Copy the new webform.module and webform.inc to the Drupal modules/ directory.

2. Go to "admin" -> "settings" ->  "webform" and select the upgrade link.

The .POT file
-------------
The .POT file is a template file for translating the module into non-english languages.
If you are not interested in helping with translation you can safely remove this file 
(and the po directory).
