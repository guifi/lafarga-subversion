Readme
------

A page listing recent nodes on your site, organized by taxonomy term. Also provides a block
for each vocabulary, listing terms and their node counts. Finally, a box is 
exported to the syndication.module main page.

Installation
------------

1. Copy all files in this directory to modules/taxonomy_dhtml/... (i.e. a directory named
   'taxonomy_dhtml' inside the Drupal modules/ directory).

2. Active this module on your admin/modules page.

Usage
------------

Just browse to the taxonomy_dhtml page.  Optionally enable a 
block for each vocabulary on your Admin -> Blocks page.

Known Issues
--------------

Some work is needed in order to generalize the collapsible list functionality from this module, 
such that other modules may benefit.
