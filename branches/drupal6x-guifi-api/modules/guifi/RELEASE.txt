NEW FEATURES in guifi.net module v4.0

New Features:
- Notification engine, every zone/node/device contact address will be contacted
  with a summary of the changes/insert/updates where he might be affected.
- New abbreviation algorithm used by default at zone level, in case the user
  doesn't provide it. The abbreviation is used while constructing the SSID using
  the mask:
    guifi.net-ZoneNodeRd#mode
- Now the multiple radio devices are always numbered in sequence starting from 0 
  and radios can be moved up & down, so can be reordered to match the position
  on the device.
- New profiles maps with the ability to dynamically create profiles directly
  over the map, working worldwide and based on heywhatsthat.com calls.
- New IPv4 engine, much faster and CPU effective.
- Users are now able to create their users at nodes, admins can approve through
  a new queue report to chech status and confirm the connection.
- Improved report for availability
- Improved reports for network & ip allocation at zones, much richer.
- New menus with most used options ant tools & utilities, with options for 
  finding available free sloots, used ip's, query MAC's, etc...

  
User interface:
- Collapsible forms to make complex forms such as edit device simpler and more
  user friendly.
- Integration with google maps while creating/editing zones (limits) or 
  nodes to select lat/lon coordinates. Google Maps gives the background,
  while the guifi.net WMS service displays the network (nodes & links) as
  a custom layer.
- Filter forms while listing candidate devices/interfaces to link with
- Now while listing neighbors nodes, provides a small icon with the line of 
  sight directly in the same report page
- Reworked breadcrumbs when makes sense, integrated with drupal's breadcrumbs
- While creating nodes from the zone maps, zone is passed as a parameter, so 
  the user has no longer the need to specify at which node is creating the node.
- Added ahah calls to validate/refresh field values, i.e. while navigating
  through a large zone hierarchy, providing the right values for firmwares
  depending on the device brand, or providing the right channel choices 
  per each selected protocol.
- While looking at the distances, there are some filters provided available 
  to be customized by the user, so no longer need to get a hughe and heavy 
  list to look for something.
- Filters also available when looking to the possible links, list is refreshed
  by ahah calls without having to reload the page.
- Enabled jquery/validation scripts for client-site validations without having
  to submit the entire form
- Added image buttons to simplify the user interface while editing devices.
- Improved reports

Database:
- Add comments on tables to document primary/foreign key relationships
- Complete rework on the database INS/DEL/UPD engine to enforce database 
  integrity. Now creates a complete dynamic statements, with no dependencies
  in column names, linked to the notification engine and with separated 
  delete, insert & update triggers for each table.
  See: _guifi_db_delete and _guifi_db_sql at guifi_includes.inc.php
- The database schema is created/dropped by using the new drupal 6.2 install 
  and uninstall procedures.
  
BUG FIXES:

TODO: 
  -Integration of zone & node location
  	-KML export for GoogleEarth
  -Define ap/client links
  -Generate a simple cnml (xml) for export/import nodes
  -Create guifi statistics/versions of nodes and track history.
  
  
... and much more! :)
