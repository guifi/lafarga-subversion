Requirements
------------

This module requires the lastest version of the current Drupal CVS version and
a working Crontab.

Installation
------------

1. Create the SQL tables. This depends a little on your system, but the most
   common method is:
     mysql -u username -ppassword drupal < notify.mysql

2. Create a subdirectory 'notify' in the Drupal modules/ directory.
   Copy the notify.module and the notify.inc to that directory.

3. Check "settings" in the administration and set the module
   settings to your liking. Note: e-mail updates can only happen as frequently
   as the crontab is setup to. Check your crontab settings.

4. To enable notifications go to "Your notifications" in the account block and
   set your settings there.
