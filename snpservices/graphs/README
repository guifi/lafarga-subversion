This software provides graph services in the context of the 
Spontaneous Networkink Platform.

Uses nodexchange as a input format, and provides traffic and
latency/availability graphs in image format by using mrtg/rrdtool 
collected history by simple HTTP URLs, therefore is easily
plugable to any web application.


INSTALL:

1.-Checkout the latest SVN version into a directory accessible by an http server:

example:
cd /var/www/html
mkdir snpservices
cd snpservices
svn checkout https://svn.projectes.lafarga.cat/svn/guifi/snpservices/graphs graphs 

To publish the directory, you might create an alias into the apache configuration 
for the directory:

Alias /snpservices /var/www/html/snpservices

2.-Get the xml filei, in nodeXchange detailed format, for the zone that this server i
will graph i.e.:

wget http://guifi.net/ca/guifi/nodexchange/2444/detail -O guifi.xml

You might create a cron job to refresh the XML file and get the latest network
description.

3.-Edit the config.php and fill the appropriate values pointing to the rrdtool
binary, the directory where the mrtg/rrdtool database files are, and the xml
nodexchange file.

4.-If you are using guifi.net as the Data Hub, edit what makes sense for you:

At guifi.module configuration, set a default url when not specified by the zone/nodes
At the zone/node that this server will graph, set the appropriate URL, i.e.:

http://guifi.net/snpservices/graphs/graphs.php
